= ABOUT
These plug-ins will work in Wiki on a Stick v0.12.0 to "BoaSize" it. They will create one or more pages that contain the interface itself, instructions, examples, or a mixture of the three. Those pages can always be found in the Plug-ins:: namespace. Click the Special::All Pages link in the menu to see a listing of all pages and find them.

= EXCEPTIONS
The jsMathPlug-inInstructions.txt file is an ordinary text file that explains all the steps necessary to install the jsMath plug-in. Note that at the time of this writing the plug-in appears to be incomplete and cannot display all equations properly.

The newreservedpage.wsif plug-in doesn't create any pages in the Plug-ins namespace and doesn't create a help page. Instead it has a newreservedpage.wsif.readme file with an explanation and instructions.

= NOTES
When any macro is used in WoaS 0.12.0, the debug console displays "WARNING: MACRONAME did not return any value" with MACRONAME being the name of the macro in question. I don't know whether this is a development feature that was accidentally left in during release or if it has some other significance, but it doesn't seem to mean the macro is not working or that it's doing any harm.

= BEFORE YOU BEGIN
All of the files in this download are plain text. I recommend inspecting their contents so you can be sure they're not malicious and they won't conflict with the content in your wiki. I also recommend installing them into an empty copy of the wiki first so you can try them out before adding them to a valued wiki.

= INSTALLATION

2. Open the wiki in a browser.
